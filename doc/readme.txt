The two objectives have their minima at x = -2 and x = +2 respectively. However, in a multiobjective problem, x = -2, x = 2, and any solution in the range -2 <= x <= 2 is equally optimal. There is no single solution to this multiobjective problem. The goal of the multiobjective genetic algorithm is to find a set of solutions in that range (ideally with a good spread). The set of solutions is also known as a Pareto front. All solutions on the Pareto front are optimal.
